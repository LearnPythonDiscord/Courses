# Courses

Welcome to the **Learn Python!** repository for all the course material and write-ups!

### What can I find here?

This repository will contain a backlog of all the weekly courses, as well as code and materials used in them.

Each week's courses are stored in a folder on the root following the naming convention of `YYYY_MM_DD_course` so they can be sorted chronologically by the file system.
